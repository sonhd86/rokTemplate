Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians through a number of is accomplishments, notably his victories in the Gallic Wars. After assuming control of the government, Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian Calendar. His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him. On the Ides of March 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Gaius Cassius Longinus, Marcus Junius Brutus, and Decimus Junius Brutus.",

In 771, Charlemagne became king of the Franks, a Germanic tribe in present-day Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and western Germany. He embarked on a mission to unite all Germanic peoples into one kingdom, and convert his subjects to Christianity. A skilled military strategist, he spent much of his reign engaged in warfare in order to accomplish his goals. In 800, Pope Leo III (750-816) crowned Charlemagne emperor of the Romans. In this role, he encouraged the Carolingian Renaissance, a cultural and intellectual revival in Europe. When he died in 814, Charlemagne’s empire encompassed much of Western Europe, and he had also ensured the survival of Christianity in the West. Today, Charlemagne is referred to by some as the father of Europe.",

One of his most famous achievements was the outbreak of the Second Punic War when he marched an army which included war elephants from Iberia over the Pyrenees and the Alps into Italy.\nIn his first few years in Italy, he won three dramatic victories – the Trebia, Lake Trasimene, and Cannae, in which he distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponents’ respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan the battle accordingly – and won over many allies of Rome.\nHannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years but was unable to march on Rome. An enemy counter-invasion of Nort Africa forced him to return to Carthage, where he was decisively defeated by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama.",
